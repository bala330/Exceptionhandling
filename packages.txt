1.What are the four access modifiers available in java and what is their significance in terms of class,method, and variable accessibility?
*Default
*Public
*Package
*protected
i) DEFAULT:
        Declarations are visible only with in the package.
Example:
package defaultpackage;
class Logic{
void message(){
system.out.printIn("What is your name");
}}
ii)PRIVATE:
        Declarations are visible with in the class only.
Example:
package privatepackage;
class A{
Private void display(){
system.out.printIn("bala");
}}
Class B{
Public static void main(String args[]){
A obj=new A();
obj.display();
Output: Error: display() has private access in A.
iii)PROTECTED:
        Declarations are visible with in the package or all subclass.
Example:
package protectedpackage1;
public class A{
protected void display(){
system.out.printIn("bala");}}
package protectedpackage2;
import protectedpackage1;
classB extendsA
{
public static void main(Stringargs[]){
B obj=new B();
obj.display();
Output:
bala

iv)PUBLIC: 
        Declarations are visible everywhere.
package protectedpackage1;
public class A{
protected void display(){
system.out.printIn("bala");}}
package protectedpackage2;
import protectedpackage1;
classB extendsA
{
public static void main(Stringargs[]){
B obj=new B();
obj.display();
Output:
bala

2.What is the difference between Exception and error?
i)Exceptions:
*It can be classified into two categories are checked and unchecked exception.
*It occurs at complie time or run time.
*Only checked exceptions are known to the compiler.
*It is mainly caused by the application itself.
*It belongs to java.lang.Exception package.
Example: Checked Exceptions: SQL Exception,IOException.
Unchecked Exceptions: ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception,NullpointerException,Arithmatic Exception.
ii)Error:
*All errors in java unchecked.
*It occurs at run time.
*Errors will not be known complier.
*It is mostly caused by the environment in which the application is running.
*It belongs to java.lang.Error package.
Example: Java.StackOverFlow,Java.lang.outofMemoryError.

3.What is difference between checked Exception and unchecked Exception?
i)Checked Exception:
*Checked exceptions occur during complie time when the source is being converted into an executable code.
*The complier checks the checked exception.
*Checked exceptions can be manually created.
*This type of exception is considered as a subclass of the exception class.
*The java virtual machine requires the checked exception to be caught or handled.
Example: File not found exception,No such field exception,Interrupted Exception,Class Not found Exception.
ii)Unchecked Exception:
*Unchecked exceptions occur during runtime when the program is in execution.
*The complier does not check these types of execptions.
*Unchecked exceptions can also be manually created.
*Unchecked exceptions occur during runtime,therefor,they are not inculded in the execption class.
*The java virtual machine does not require the unchecked exception to be caught or handled.
Example: No such element Exception,Arithmetic Exception,Null ponter Exception, Array Index out of bound exception.
